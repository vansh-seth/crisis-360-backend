# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Crisis 360 Backend

Crisis 360 Backend is a repository designed to support Crisis 360, a web application aimed at providing real-time crisis management and response solutions. This backend repository serves as the core engine for the Crisis 360 application, handling various functionalities such as user authentication, data storage, and retrieval.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure user authentication system allowing registered users to log in securely.
- **Data Management**: Efficient storage and retrieval of crisis-related data, ensuring quick access to critical information during emergencies.
- **Real-time Updates**: Utilizes real-time communication protocols to provide instant updates and notifications to users and administrators.
- **Scalability**: Built with scalability in mind to handle large volumes of data and users during crisis situations.
- **Modular Architecture**: Designed with a modular architecture, allowing for easy integration with other systems and components.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: Backend server runtime environment.
- **Express.js**: Web application framework for Node.js, facilitating the development of robust APIs.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for efficient storage and retrieval of crisis-related data.
- **Socket.IO**: Real-time bidirectional event-based communication library for implementing instant updates and notifications.
- **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**: Used for secure authentication and authorization of users.
- **bcrypt**: Library for hashing passwords to enhance security.

## Getting Started
